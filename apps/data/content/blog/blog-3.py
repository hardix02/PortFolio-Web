Together, they power AI that can spot cats in photos or predict your next binge-watch.</p>", "<h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl text-medium mt-4 md:mt-5 mb-2 md:mb-3'>Building Your First Neural Network</h2>", "<p class='mb-4 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'>Let's build something real: a neural network to classify handwritten digits (MNIST dataset—classic!). Start with <code>tensorflow.keras.Sequential()</code> to stack layers—think <code>Dense(128, activation='relu')</code> for the brains and <code>softmax</code> for the final guess. Keras makes it stupid simple to add layers like LEGO bricks.</p>", "<h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl text-medium mt-4 md:mt-5 mb-2 md:mb-3'>Training and Optimization</h2>", "<p class='mb-4 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'>Training's where the magic happens. Feed your model data with <code>model.fit()</code>, tweak it with epochs (like 5-10), and watch it learn. TensorFlow's handling the math under the hood—gradients, backprop, all that jazz. Use <code>model.evaluate()</code> to check accuracy—aim for 95%+ to flex.</p>", "<h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl text-medium mt-4 md:mt-5 mb-2 md:mb-3'>Advanced Deep Learning Techniques</h2>", "<p class='mb-4 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'>Wanna go deeper? Play with CNNs for image recognition (<code>Conv2D</code>) or RNNs for text (<code>LSTM</code>). Overfitting? Toss in <code>Dropout(0.2)</code>. Debug with TensorBoard to visualize your model's vibe. I've used this combo for sentiment analysis and image classifiers—it's legit.</p>", "<h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl text-medium mt-4 md:mt-5 mb-2 md:mb-3'>Getting Started with TensorFlow</h2>", "<p class='mb-4 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'>Kick it off with <code>pip install tensorflow</code> and Google Colab if your laptop's not beefy. Try coding a model to guess movie genres from posters—fun and doable. Keep experimenting, and you'll be an AI wizard before you know it.</p>"],
